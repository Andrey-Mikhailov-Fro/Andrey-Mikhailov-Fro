### Hello! My name is Andrey!
    I am a `frontend-developer` with experience in building web applications. I specialize in using languages and technologies such as JavaScript and the React framework.
    I focus particularly on creating interactive user interfaces, and I use the Redux Toolkit library to efficiently manage application state and simplify the development process.
    I have worked on several projects where my main goal was to create user-friendly and responsive interfaces that provide a positive user experience. I enjoy keeping up with modern trends in development and continually learning new tools and approaches to enhance the quality of my work.
    I also highly value teamwork and believe that close collaboration with other developers, designers, and project managers is the key to successfully delivering a product. I am open to exploring collaboration opportunities and am eager to share my skills and experience.
